just and autoclicker for minecraft, with good randomization
just and autoclicker for minecraft, with good randomization, this clicker can bypass mmc, hypixel, astral, vulcan ac, verus, polar, etc... just use normal cps

best configs, 17/06/2024

- MMC = 8.0 CPS - 16.0 CPS
- ASTRAL = 10.0 CPS - 18.0 CPS
- HYPIXEL = 8.0 CPS - 16.0 CPS
- VULCAN AC = 7.0 CPS - 14.0 CPS (has good clicker check)
- VERUS = 10.0 CPS - 18.0 CPS
- POLAR = 8.0 CPS - 16.0 CPS (universocraft anti mitigate)

for randomization to work well you have to put many cps together, example: 8.0 - 16.0 cps, would be between 10-15 stable CPS with good randomization
